              <h2>OUR VALUES</h2>

              Unlike other online players, we NEVER source anything from the ‘grey market’, choosing to only offer products that are 100% authentic, sourced directly from the brands or authorized distributors. Our authenticity also extends to all aspects of how we run our business. From its very inception, Ciiku has strived to set the benchmark in product quality control so that customers are assured of receiving 100% genuine and fresh products sourced directly from manufacturers or their authorized distributors.</p>

              <h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>
              <p>At Ciiku we believe that beauty comes from within and radiates outwards. Our vision is to help boost women’s confidence and self-esteem and to make them feel beautiful!</p>

              <h2>WHY US</h2>
              <p>At Ciiku we have identified that our customers increasingly have more hectic lifestyles and have the need to find some time for themselves. In order to satisfy their needs, we have decided to provide a unique online store that gives a one stop shop solution to all things beauty and wellness. Ciiku hub is an important extension to the image and personality of beauty in terms of pricing, variety of products and ease of access. Consumers will enjoy shopping for their personal brand while at home and enjoy a different kind of experience. This enhanced experience is aligned with our philosophy and vision, making women feel beautiful every moment, everywhere. Ciiku.co.ke will be the core digital platform integrated with all channels: social media presence, blogs, and some retail stores, creating a consistent and a unique brand experience.</p>
